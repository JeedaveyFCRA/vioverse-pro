# CLAUDE.md - VIOVERSE CLEAN SITE PROJECT

## ðŸ”´ CRITICAL PRIORITIES - NEVER VIOLATE
1. **DATA-DRIVEN EVERYTHING** - No hardcoded values. Every number, text, coordinate comes from CSV/JSON
2. **RESPONSIVE FIRST** - Must work perfectly on mobile, tablet, and desktop
3. **SEPARATION OF CONCERNS** - Data logic, business logic, and presentation must never mix

## Project Overview
This is a fresh, clean Vioverse website project, completely isolated from the existing codebase. Built on Viobox System v2.0 architecture.
