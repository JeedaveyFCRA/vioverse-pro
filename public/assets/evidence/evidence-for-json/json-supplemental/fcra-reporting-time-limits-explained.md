# FCRA Reporting Time Limits Explained

## Legal Framework: 15 U.S.C. ยง1681c(a)

The Fair Credit Reporting Act establishes specific time limits for how long negative information can remain on credit reports. These are mandatory federal requirements, not optional guidelines.

### Key Time Limits Relevant to This Case:

1. **Chapter 13 Bankruptcy**: 7 years from filing date
   - Filed: October 25, 2018
   - Must be removed by: October 2025

2. **Charged-off Accounts**: 7 years from Date of First Delinquency (DOFD)
   - Each account has its own DOFD
   - Removal dates vary by account

3. **Collection Accounts**: 7 years from original delinquency date
   - Not from when sold to collector
   - Based on original creditor's DOFD

## Why Creditors "Stop Reporting" at Different Times

When a creditor's tradeline disappears from a credit report, it's typically because:

1. **Legal Time Limit Reached**: The account hit its 7-year mark
2. **Bureau Compliance**: Credit bureaus must remove aged accounts
3. **Automated Removal**: Most removals happen automatically at 7 years + 180 days

## Important Clarifications:

- **Not a Choice**: Creditors don't "choose" to stop reporting at 7 years - they're legally required to
- **Not Correction**: Removal due to aging is NOT the same as correcting false information
- **Violations Continue**: If an account reported falsely for 6.5 years before aging off, that's 6.5 years of violations

## Bureau Variations:

Creditors may report to one, two, or all three bureaus. When accounts age off at different times across bureaus, it may be due to:
- Different DOFDs recorded by each bureau
- Different compliance processes
- Technical variations in removal timing

## Key Point for This Case:

The fact that 69% of creditors' accounts aged off by 2025 does NOT indicate:
- Consciousness of wrongdoing
- Strategic decisions
- Voluntary correction

It simply means these accounts reached their mandatory 7-year reporting limit while still containing false information that was never corrected during the entire reporting period.

## Legal Significance:

The persistence of false reporting until the very last legal moment (7 years) demonstrates:
- No attempt to correct errors
- Maximum harm inflicted for maximum duration
- Willful disregard for accuracy requirements under FCRA ยง1681s-2(a) and ยง1681e(b)

This strengthens FCRA claims by showing violations continued for the entire legally permissible reporting period.
