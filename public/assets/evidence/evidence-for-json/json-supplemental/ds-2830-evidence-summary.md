# DS 2830 Evidence Summary - Administrative Reopening and Credit Score Destruction

## Executive Summary
The DS 2830 (Domestic Support Obligation) form requirement triggered a cascade of creditor misreporting that caused a 107-point TransUnion score drop and ongoing credit suppression. This administrative case reopening - purely for filing a required form - was exploited by creditors to report false delinquencies, creating the central harm pattern in David Marra's FCRA case.

## Key Pattern Elements

### 1. DS 2830 Administrative Timeline
- **November 16, 2023**: Law office notice - must file DS 2830 form or case closes WITHOUT discharge
- **December 2023**: Case temporarily closed (administrative only) for missing form
- **January 2024**: David Marra pays $525 to reopen case solely to file DS 2830 form
- **January 17, 2024**: Best Egg alert - creditors report "damaging activity" during reopening
- **January 22, 2024**: Experian confirms 41-point drop (5 days after TransUnion's 107-point plunge)
- **February 9, 2024**: Official discharge granted after DS 2830 filed

### 2. The 107-Point Score Drop Pattern
- **Pre-DS 2830 Issue**: TransUnion score 684 (April 2023)
- **During Reopening**: TransUnion drops to 577 (-107 points)
- **Trigger**: Administrative case reopening misinterpreted as dismissal/reversal
- **Result**: Scores remain suppressed through 2025, blocking all refinancing

### 3. Creditor Exploitation Pattern
According to Master-Evidence-Data files (v3 and v4), all 13 creditors show:
- **DS2830_Administrative_Reopening** violation category
- **DS2830_Score_Drop_Pattern**: TRUE for creditors causing score damage
- **DS2830_Recovery_Correlation**: TRUE for creditors who ceased reporting (consistent with FCRA §1681c(a) 7-year limits)

### 4. Bureau-Specific Impacts
- **TransUnion**: 107-point drop from accepting $52,604 in false high balances
- **Experian**: 41-point drop showing more restraint but still harmful
- **Equifax**: Reported "Dismissed/Closed" instead of "Discharged" through April 2024

## FCRA Violations Established

### §1681e(b) - Failure to Ensure Maximum Possible Accuracy
- Creditors reported delinquencies during administrative reopening
- Bureaus accepted obviously false data without verification
- Pattern continued for 405+ days post-discharge

### §1681s-2(a)(1)(A) - Furnishing Inaccurate Information
- 13 creditors simultaneously reported false delinquencies
- Timing proves coordination during DS 2830 window
- Continued reporting after February 9, 2024 discharge

### §1681i - Failure to Investigate Disputes
- Discover took 13+ months to correct (March 2025)
- Other creditors never corrected despite disputes
- Pattern of ignoring valid bankruptcy discharge

## Quantifiable Harm from DS 2830 Pattern

### Immediate Financial Impact
- **Credit Denials**: Best Egg (April 2024, November 2024), Capital One (January 2025)
- **Mortgage Denial**: Rocket Mortgage refinance blocked (needed 640, had 600)
- **Interest Rate Penalty**: 13.98% vs 12.99% on approved loans
- **Monthly Loss**: $1,000+ in excess mortgage payments continuing

### Score Suppression Timeline
1. **April 2023**: TransUnion 684 (baseline)
2. **January 17, 2024**: TransUnion 577 (-107 during DS 2830 reopening)
3. **January 22, 2024**: Experian 596 (-41 during DS 2830 reopening)
4. **Current**: Scores remain suppressed, preventing financial recovery

## Legal Significance

### Willfulness Indicators
1. **Timing**: All violations occurred during known administrative reopening
2. **Coordination**: 13 creditors reported simultaneously
3. **Persistence**: Continued for 405+ days despite discharge
4. **Reporting Duration**: 69% of accounts aged off per FCRA §1681c(a) 7-year limit

### Causation Chain Established
1. DS 2830 form requirement → Administrative case reopening
2. Reopening mischaracterized → Creditors report false delinquencies
3. False reporting → 107-point TransUnion score drop
4. Score drop → Credit denials and mortgage refinance blocked
5. Ongoing suppression → Continued financial harm through 2025

## Key Takeaway
The DS 2830 administrative reopening was NOT a dismissal, reversal, or substantive change to the bankruptcy. It was purely procedural - filing one required form. Yet creditors exploited this administrative window to destroy David Marra's credit through coordinated false reporting, causing quantifiable harm that continues today. This pattern, now documented across all evidence files, forms the core of the FCRA violation claims.
