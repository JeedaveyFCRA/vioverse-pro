TransUnion vs Experian: Credit Score Drop Analysis
Examining why TransUnion dropped 107 points while Experian dropped only 41
Overview
This analysis compares the sharp drop in TransUnion and Experian credit scores around January 2024, immediately following the brief administrative reopening of David Marra's Chapter 13 bankruptcy case. Despite both scores being affected, the disparity in impact is significant:

Credit Bureau	Reported Score Drop	Approx. Final Score	Date of Change
TransUnion	-107 points	684 → 577	Jan 17, 2024 (via Best Egg)
Experian	-41 points	637 → 596	Jan 22, 2024 (via Experian.com)
Likely Causes of the Disparity
1. Bureau Timing Differences: TransUnion reported damaging activity on Jan 17 — five days before Experian’s reported drop. Alerts from Best Egg (TransUnion-based) specifically flagged:

JPMCB – Charge-Off (Dec 2023)
Sears/CBNA – 90 Days Past Due
Best Buy/CBNA – 90 Days Past Due
Discover – Charge-Off (Dec 2023)
2. Post-Discharge vs Pre-Discharge Weight: The duplicate derogatory reporting and serious delinquencies from TransUnion appeared to carry forward into post-discharge scoring models, while Experian suppressed some of that weight, especially given the $0 balances.

3. Potential Scoring Model Differences: TransUnion may have used a version of VantageScore or an older FICO model that responded more harshly to clustered delinquencies than Experian’s version.

Experian Score Drop Evidence
Conclusion
The 107-point TransUnion collapse is more severe than Experian’s due to earlier reporting, heavier derogatory content, and possibly stricter scoring behavior. This evidence strengthens the argument for FCRA claims, showing disparate harm depending on the bureau’s data accuracy and update timing.
