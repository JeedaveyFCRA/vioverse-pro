Subject: Emotional and Financial Impact of False Credit Reporting
Dear Cornerstone Community FCU,
I, David V. Marra, am submitting this statement to document the severe emotional and financial distress caused by your inaccurate credit reporting following my Chapter 13 bankruptcy discharge on February 9, 2024.
1. Repeated Loan Denials & Financial Barriers
Since my bankruptcy discharge, Cornerstone Community FCU has continued to report my account inaccurately as “Included in Bankruptcy” with an outstanding balance, despite the debt being discharged. These errors have resulted in:
April 23, 2024 & November 22, 2024: Best Egg denied my loan applications, citing a high debt-to-income (DTI) ratio caused by this false reporting.
January 2025: Capital One denied my credit line increase request, specifically citing:
“Too many seriously delinquent or derogatory obligations” from my Equifax credit report.
This derogatory information directly stems from your failure to update my account status to reflect the bankruptcy discharge, as required by law. Each rejection has caused significant stress, embarrassment, and frustration, as I am being unfairly penalized for errors beyond my control.

2. Increased Interest Rates & Financial Hardship
March 2023: Best Egg approved me for a $10,000 loan at 12.99% APR.
January 2025: Best Egg approved a second $4,000 loan but at a 13.98% APR—nearly 1% higher.
My credit profile was nearly identical between these two applications, yet I was charged a higher interest rate solely due to your inaccurate reporting. This has directly increased my borrowing costs, adding unnecessary financial strain to my life.

3. Emotional Toll & Ongoing Distress
The persistent inaccuracies on my credit report have caused significant emotional harm, including:
Severe stress and anxiety over my financial stability.
Lost sleep due to constant worry about the impact on my creditworthiness.
A feeling of powerlessness over my financial future.
I should not have to endure this emotional and financial burden when I have fully complied with my bankruptcy discharge and met all legal obligations.

3a. Compounded Harm from Administrative Bankruptcy Reopening
The emotional impact of your false reporting was severely amplified by administrative requirements following my discharge. My bankruptcy case was briefly reopened in January 2024 solely to file Form DS 2830 (Domestic Support Obligation Form)—a routine administrative filing required for bankruptcy completion. This was NOT due to any payment issues or non-compliance on my part.

During this brief administrative window, multiple creditors including Cornerstone Community FCU began reporting negative information, causing my TransUnion score to plummet 107 points. The timing of your negative reporting during this procedural reopening has caused disproportionate and unnecessary harm that continues to suppress my credit scores.

3b. Ongoing Credit Score Suppression Despite Discharge
Despite my diligent efforts to rebuild my credit following the February 9, 2024 discharge, your continued misreporting has prevented meaningful score recovery:
• Pre-discharge credit scores: Above 620 across all bureaus
• Immediate post-discharge drop: 107 points on TransUnion alone
• Current scores (February 2025): Still suppressed at 596, classified as "Very Poor"
• Duration of suppression: Over 12 months and continuing

This sustained suppression—directly caused by your failure to properly update discharged accounts—prevents me from achieving the fresh start guaranteed by bankruptcy law. The administrative DS 2830 filing should never have triggered negative reporting, yet your actions during that window continue to damage my financial recovery.

4. Request for Immediate Correction & Compensation
I respectfully request that Cornerstone Community FCU:
Immediately correct my credit report to reflect the discharged status of my account and remove any false balances or inaccuracies.
Compensate me for the financial and emotional harm caused by your failure to accurately report my account status, as required by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA).
Acknowledge the compounded harm caused by reporting errors during the DS 2830 administrative filing period and the ongoing suppression of my credit scores despite 12+ months passing since discharge.
I certify that the above statement is true and accurate to the best of my knowledge.



Sincerely,



David V. Marra
