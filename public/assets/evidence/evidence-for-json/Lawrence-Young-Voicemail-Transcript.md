“Hey David, it's Lawrence with Rocket Mortgage calling you back. I just wanted to follow up since I missed your call. Feel free to reach back out at 313-545-0225 — once again 313-545-0225. Thanks, and I hope you have a good one.”

Context Note:
I returned the call the same day and spoke with Lawrence for approximately 15 minutes. During the call, he reviewed his internal notes and recalled previous discussions about my refinance application. He confirmed that I had been informed of two specific credit-related conditions: raising my score above 640 or paying down $10,000 in personal debt.
