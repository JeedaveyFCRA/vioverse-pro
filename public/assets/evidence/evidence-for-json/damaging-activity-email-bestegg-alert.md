Explanation from David Marra:
Within days of my Chapter 13 bankruptcy case being temporarily closed for administrative reasons, I received this alert showing major derogatory events were being reported to TransUnion. It triggered a sharp credit score drop (estimated 100+ points) and caused significant emotional distress as it appeared my entire repayment history had been wiped or ignored by creditors. These types of alerts from Best Egg and others have continued since that time.
