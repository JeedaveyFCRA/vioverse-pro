Summary
This email chain with Jessica Vest (Rocket Mortgage Resolution Advocate) documents:

Repeated requests for written confirmation of the 640 credit score threshold and $10,000 debt paydown requirement that blocked my refinance

2Ô∏è‚É£ Any recorded details of the credit score threshold (640) or personal debt reduction requirement ($10,000) that was communicated to me as necessary for my refinance application to proceed.

Email from Jessica, March 6, 2025: 


Hi David!
 
I am not finding anything additional to add to the two documents provided. The newest loan was not taken out of process due to credit.
 
Is there something additional needed or do you think what was provided is sufficient?

Email from me, March 6, 2025: 

Dear Jessica,
I appreciate your time and assistance with my request. I wanted to follow up regarding the Credit Upgrade Department referral during my refinance attempt in April 2024.
Would it be possible to obtain a brief confirmation from Jacob Dufurrena and/or Lawrence Young stating:
That I was referred to the Credit Upgrade Department as part of my refinance inquiry.
That I was informed my refinance could not proceed unless my credit score was raised above 640 or I paid down $10,000 in personal debt.
I recently spoke with Lawrence Young, who clearly remembered my case and confirmed that these conditions were set for my refinance.
I understand formal policy documents may not be available, but even a brief confirmation of these key details would be extremely helpful in addressing credit reporting discrepancies that have negatively impacted my financial standing. This documentation is a crucial step in correcting these issues and moving forward.
Please let me know if this is possible or if you need any further details from me.
Thanks again for your help‚ÄîI truly appreciate your time and consideration.
Best regards,
David V. Marra

Hi Mr. Marra, I was able to draft an outline of what happened. Unfortunately, I am unable to provide specific figures as it is not notated or listed in the file

Email from me, March 14, 2025: 
Dear Jessica,
Thank you for providing the confirmation letter‚ÄîI appreciate your help.
I just wanted to clarify one point. My understanding was that I was referred to the Credit Upgrade Department and advised that my refinance could not proceed unless I:
 Increased my credit score above 640
 Paid down at least $10,000 in personal debt
Could you confirm whether these conditions were part of the guidance I received? Just looking to ensure my records are accurate.
Thanks again for your time!
Best,
David V. Marra

Hi Mr. Marra,


I looked into the 2 questions below. Unfortunately, I cannot confirm or deny that these conditions were apart of the process and communication.
 
Please give me a call to further discuss or if anything additional is needed.

Hi David!
 
I am waiting for our internal research team to get back with me on the communication/expectations set at that time.
 
I will keep you updated!

Hi David,
 
Unfortunately, due to the timing of the correspondence, we are unable to confirm the figures, and score needed as discussed.
 
If anything, additional is needed, please let me know and I will try to get you what is needed.

Email from me, March 25, 2025:


Hi  Jessica,
Thank you again for your efforts in gathering documents. However, none of the four attachments provided contain the crucial internal notes or documentation that were specifically referenced in my prior communications with Jacob Duferrena (via email) and Lawrence Young (via phone) regarding my denied refinance request.
To be clear, I am still seeking one of the following:
Written confirmation or summary of the internal decision-making notes from Rocket‚Äôs Credit Upgrade Department.
A brief written statement from either Jacob Duferrena or Lawrence Young outlining the reason I was referred to the Credit Upgrade Department and the score or debt thresholds communicated.
An internal summary or transcript of my phone call with Lawrence Young, which was conducted on a recorded line, including any notes taken or decisions discussed during that conversation.
Even a short paragraph is sufficient. I am not requesting anything complicated‚Äîjust a factual acknowledgment of what was discussed and documented.
As a reminder, my case involved an internal block of my refinance application due to my credit score being below 640. I was referred to the Credit Upgrade Department and advised that I would need to either:
Raise my score to 640+, OR
Pay down approximately $10,000 in debt to qualify.
This internal decision was confirmed by both Jacob Duferrena and Lawrence Young, yet no formal record of this requirement has been provided. It is especially concerning that Rocket Mortgage appears to be withholding documentation that directly affected my ability to access credit.
Both Jacob and Lawrence were professional and helpful. Lawrence, in particular, recalled our entire conversation and referred to his notes during our call. It is clear that internal documentation exists, and I am simply asking for a copy or confirmation.
Given the seriousness of this issue‚Äîand the extensive delays‚ÄîI am respectfully making this request before initiating a formal complaint with the CFPB, FTC, and other applicable regulatory agencies. These complaints will document Rocket‚Äôs refusal to produce internal records tied to a credit denial.
Please respond by April 3, 2025.
I would still prefer to resolve this cooperatively and avoid escalation. I appreciate your continued efforts and look forward to your response.
Sincerely,
David Marra
