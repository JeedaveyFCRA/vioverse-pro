Sears/CBNA – 90 Days Past Due Report (January 2024)
Delinquency reported just 30 days before bankruptcy discharge
Summary
This document shows Sears/CBNA reporting the account as 90 days past due on January 9, 2024—exactly one month before my Chapter 13 bankruptcy discharge. While the balance was reported as $0.00, the delinquent status itself likely damaged my credit profile during a sensitive window of recovery. This harmful activity was independently flagged in a Best Egg “Damaging Activity” alert email on January 17, 2024, providing real-time confirmation of impact.

FCRA Relevance
This report may violate FCRA §1681e(b), which requires maximum possible accuracy. Reporting a 90-day delinquency just before a bankruptcy discharge—while showing a $0 balance—could be misleading or unfair to creditors. The fact that this was flagged as damaging activity in a consumer alert adds additional weight to the claim of actual harm caused.

Timeline Placement
🔵 Post-confirmation (during repayment) — reported just one month before discharge on February 9, 2024.

Harm Index
🟠 Moderate – Negative delinquency flagged shortly before bankruptcy discharge
