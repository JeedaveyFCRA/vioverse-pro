Subject: Emotional and Financial Impact of False Credit Reporting - Account xxxxxx8116

Dear Citizens Bank,

I, David V. Marra, am submitting this statement to document the severe emotional and financial distress caused by your inaccurate credit reporting following my Chapter 13 bankruptcy discharge on February 9, 2024.

1. Pattern of Violation and Cessation

Your handling of my second account ending in 8116 mirrors exactly what occurred with account 7849 - false reporting of "INCLUDED_IN_CHAPTER_13" status after discharge, followed by simultaneous cessation of all reporting without correction. This pattern across both accounts shows:

- Systematic false reporting of active bankruptcy status post-discharge
- Simultaneous cessation across both accounts without remediation
- Leaving false information uncorrected after ceasing to report
- A pattern that resulted in continued consumer harm

The synchronized nature of these actions across two separate accounts demonstrates systematic issues rather than isolated errors.

2. Double Impact on Credit Profile and Lending Decisions

Having two accounts from the same institution falsely reporting bankruptcy status created amplified harm:

- Double the derogatory account count affecting credit scoring algorithms
- Inflated debt-to-income ratios from two accounts showing unresolved bankruptcy
- Enhanced negative impact on "number of accounts with delinquency" metrics
- Compounded damage when lenders saw multiple Citizens accounts in violation

This double impact directly contributed to:
- Best Egg loan denials (April 23, 2024 and November 22, 2024)
- Capital One credit line increase denial (January 2025)
- Mortgage refinancing obstacles throughout 2024-2025
- Higher interest rates on approved credit applications

3. State-Chartered Bank Obligations and Regulatory Concerns

As a New York state-chartered institution, Citizens Bank operates under enhanced consumer protection obligations through NYDFS oversight. Your pattern of:
- Initial FCRA violations through false bankruptcy reporting
- Cessation without correction
- Cessation across multiple consumer accounts
- Leaving harmful information unremedied

raises serious questions about compliance with both federal FCRA requirements and New York State banking regulations designed to protect consumers from predatory or harmful practices.

4. Ongoing Harm from Unresolved Reporting

Your cessation of reporting rather than correcting errors has created a unique form of ongoing harm:

- I cannot dispute tradelines that no longer exist
- The damage from your false reporting remains embedded in credit scoring models
- Other creditors and bureaus point to your historical reporting as justification
- The "ghost" of your misreporting continues affecting my creditworthiness

This cessation without remediation represents a form of FCRA violation that leaves consumers without recourse while preserving the harm caused.

4a. Compounded Harm from Administrative Bankruptcy Reopening

The emotional impact of your false reporting was severely amplified by administrative requirements following my discharge. My bankruptcy case was briefly reopened in January 2024 solely to file Form DS 2830 (Domestic Support Obligation Form)—a routine administrative filing required for bankruptcy completion. This was NOT due to any payment issues or non-compliance on my part.

During this brief administrative window, multiple creditors including Citizens Bank began reporting negative information, causing my TransUnion score to plummet 107 points. The timing of your negative reporting during this procedural reopening has caused disproportionate and unnecessary harm that continues to suppress my credit scores.

4b. Ongoing Credit Score Suppression Despite Discharge

Despite my diligent efforts to rebuild my credit following the February 9, 2024 discharge, your continued misreporting has prevented meaningful score recovery:
• Pre-discharge credit scores: Above 620 across all bureaus
• Immediate post-discharge drop: 107 points on TransUnion alone
• Current scores (February 2025): Still suppressed at 596, classified as "Very Poor"
• Duration of suppression: Over 12 months and continuing

This sustained suppression—directly caused by your failure to properly update discharged accounts—prevents me from achieving the fresh start guaranteed by bankruptcy law. The administrative DS 2830 filing should never have triggered negative reporting, yet your actions during that window continue to damage my financial recovery.

5. Request for Comprehensive Resolution

Given the coordinated nature of violations across both accounts, I request that Citizens Bank:

1. Acknowledge the systematic nature of false reporting across accounts 7849 and 8116
2. Take affirmative steps to remediate all lingering effects of your misreporting
3. Compensate me for enhanced damages from coordinated violations across multiple accounts
4. Submit to NYDFS a plan to prevent future cessation without correction
5. Provide written assurance that no residual negative information remains in any credit reporting system
6. Acknowledge the compounded harm caused by reporting errors during the DS 2830 administrative filing period and the ongoing suppression of my credit scores despite 12+ months passing since discharge

The simultaneous cessation of both accounts after documented violations, without any attempt at correction, transforms what might have been negligent errors into a pattern suggesting willful noncompliance with FCRA obligations.

Your institution's cessation of reporting rather than correcting has left me bearing the full weight of your reporting errors - a burden that continues to impact my financial opportunities and emotional well-being more than a year after my bankruptcy discharge.

I certify that the above statement is true and accurate to the best of my knowledge.


Sincerely,


David V. Marra
