Hi David,

I received your voicemail and I wanted to make sure I returned the correspondence same day, but I realize it's almost 10pm there, so I figured an email is more appropriate than a phone call.

The Discover charge-off thing is unfortunate, but there's a silver-lining, because once they correct that, it should immediately correct your scores, without you needing to pay down balances on your own. Fingers crossed, it doesn't take them long to fix it.

Please keep me posted as updates come.

Warm regards,
Jacob Dufurrena
President's Club Banker, Rocket Mortgage
