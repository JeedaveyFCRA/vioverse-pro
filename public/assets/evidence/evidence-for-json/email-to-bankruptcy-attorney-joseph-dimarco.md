Dear Mr. DiMarco,

On January 26, I paid your law office $525 to reopen my Chapter 13 case (because I did not submit the signed DB2830 Domestic Support Obligation (DSO) on time in order to get the bankruptcy discharged).

Nicole acknowledged she received my signed form and I believe that you have reopened my case to submit the form.

The problem is many of my former creditors have been reporting derogatory information to the credit bureaus, which has dramatically brought down my credit score.

My question is, do I have any protections, rights, and/or recourse to fix the situation because the case has been reopened? And could I possibly sue them if they donâ€™t stop?

Thank you very much and I look forward to your response.

Here is a screenshot from my credit report.

JPMCB Card â€“ Damaging activity detected
Sears/CBNA â€“ Payment overdue
Best Buy/CBNA â€“ Payment overdue
Discover Bank â€“ Damaging activity detected
ðŸ“Ž This email was sent before my contact with Discover Loans, who initially told me no updates would be made to my credit report. However, over one year later, they reversed their position and issued a formal correction (see letter dated March 18, 2025).
