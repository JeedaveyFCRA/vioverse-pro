Subject: Urgent Notice Regarding Bankruptcy Discharge

Dear David:

You are receiving this notice because you have not yet completed one of the steps necessary to obtain your bankruptcy discharge. If you are a married couple filing jointly, each of you must complete a form.

Please Complete and Mail Back the Attached Domestic Support Obligation Form.

This form indicates that you have no unpaid domestic support obligation since the filing of your bankruptcy case. It is required of ALL Chapter 13 cases, whether or not you have ever owed alimony or child support.

The failure to file the Domestic Support Obligation form with the Court will result in the closing of your case without a discharge of your debts. If this happens, you can only obtain a discharge by re-opening the case. This will result in fees to the Court of $235 and legal fees to our office of $500. Please give this your immediate attention. You may return this form by mail, fax (716-853-1378), or email it to nmacartney@grubealaw.com.
