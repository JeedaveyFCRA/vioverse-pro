Best Buy CBNA – Reported 90 Days Past Due
Best Buy CBNA Reports Account As 90 Days Past Due – 2024-01-13

Summary
This document reveals that Best Buy CBNA (via Experian) reported my account as 90 days past due on January 13, 2024. This occurred just weeks before my Chapter 13 discharge and may indicate a failure to suppress or correct derogatory status codes. This exact event was flagged in a Best Egg “Damaging Activity” email on January 17, 2024—validating the real-world credit harm caused.

FCRA Relevance
This may violate FCRA §1681c(a)(1) and FCRA §1681e(b) due to the retention and reporting of a serious delinquency too close to (and potentially after) my discharge. It reflects a failure to ensure accurate, current, and non-damaging data in accordance with my legal status. The appearance in the Best Egg alert adds an extra layer of evidence that this error had material consequences.

Timeline Placement
🔴 Post-Discharge (Early) – While the delinquency was reported in January 2024, it carried over into the post-discharge period and contributed to my June 2024 score collapse.

Harm Index
🔴 Severe – A 90-day past due mark is among the most harmful derogatory entries. It significantly contributes to credit score suppression and denial risk, and this was confirmed in real-time by a damaging activity alert.
