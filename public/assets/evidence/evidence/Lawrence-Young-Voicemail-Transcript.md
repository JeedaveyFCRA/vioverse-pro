Lawrence-Young-Voicemail-Transcription
Rocket Mortgage voicemail referencing prior Credit Upgrade discussions and credit denial conditions
Summary
This voicemail from Lawrence Young at Rocket Mortgage, received on March 4, 2025, confirms an ongoing dialogue regarding credit issues that prevented my refinance application from moving forward. While the voicemail itself is brief, it directly connects to a same-day 15-minute phone call in which Lawrence referenced his internal notes and confirmed that I had been advised to improve my credit score above 640 or reduce personal debt by $10,000 in order to qualify. This document helps establish the existence of specific refinance denial conditions discussed and remembered by Rocket staff.

FCRA Relevance
This evidence may be used to support claims under FCRA ¬ß1681e(b) (failure to ensure accuracy) and ¬ß1681s-2(b) (failure to investigate after notice), by demonstrating that internal documentation and verbal guidance were provided by Rocket Mortgage regarding credit barriers, which contradict the lack of written policy disclosures. It supports the narrative that inaccurate or incomplete credit data directly prevented loan approval. [Draft ‚Äì pending legal mapping]

Context Note:
I returned the call the same day and spoke with Lawrence for approximately 15 minutes. During the call, he reviewed his internal notes and recalled previous discussions about my refinance application. He confirmed that I had been informed of two specific credit-related conditions: raising my score above 640 or paying down $10,000 in personal debt.
