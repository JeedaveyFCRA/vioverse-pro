You‚Äôre building a flawless naming system ‚Äî and I‚Äôll keep perfect alignment going forward.



David chat:



So here is where I feel like there is an issue of wanting to classify individual items rather than the type of item that it is. For example:

üß≠ BSB ‚Äì Bureau Selector Box (group-level container)



It's not so much a BSB or a Bureau Selector Box. It's a generic box that can be used anywhere that contains items. It's got the same border radius. The only thing different about it is the width and height. The components inside of it have nothing to do with this box. It's a classification in its own. This box only has a border, a rounded corner radius, a stroke, a fill, a certain relative type of padding, two left and right sides, between type in itself, above and below, and how it relates to everything around it. So that's what I thought you meant when you would make them universal items. Isn't that what you were trying to convey before earlier in this discussion? What you're doing is showing the the instance of that box and you're again you're making it very specific. This is a box that could be used anywhere and it has the properties how it relates relative on the page to other items. Tell me if you understand this and maybe we should rethink this and because I want to do this once and have a universal setup. Now I agree you would have to give the relative information for the BSB because that that takes a certain place on the page with certain dimensions but the characteristics of that box is universal. So let's see if you can realize the difference and let's talk about it.



Chat response 



Yes, David ‚Äî I 100% understand what you‚Äôre saying, and you‚Äôre absolutely right to call this out.



You‚Äôre describing the critical distinction between:



‚∏ª



üîπ 1. Component Type (Universal)



What it is, visually and structurally ‚Äî regardless of where it appears.



Versus:



üî∏ 2. Component Instance (Contextual Use)



How it‚Äôs being used in a particular layout, with specific spacing or content.



‚∏ª



‚úÖ Your Clarification in Plain Terms



You‚Äôre saying:



‚ÄúDon‚Äôt call it a Bureau Selector Box (BSB) ‚Äî that‚Äôs just one use of a reusable container style.

I want to define the type of container (e.g., soft gray pill box with padding, stroke, rounded corners) ‚Äî and treat it as a universal layout object.‚Äù



And you‚Äôre right.



Instead of treating it like:



BSB ‚Äì Bureau Selector Box



‚Ä¶it should be:



CON ‚Äì Content Box (or better: GRB ‚Äì Generic Rounded Box)

A universal container that holds other elements, used throughout the system.



Then separately, we define how that box is used on this page (position, width, context).



‚∏ª



üß† This Is a Core Design System Principle



What you‚Äôre asking for is the equivalent of:

‚Ä¢ Tokenized base styles ‚Üí define what a thing looks like

‚Ä¢ Component instancing ‚Üí define where and how it‚Äôs used



‚∏ª



‚úÖ The Correct Way to Reframe



Let‚Äôs break this down as a universal spec + usage context, using your example:



‚∏ª



üü¶ GRB ‚Äì Generic Rounded Box (Universal Container)

Property

Value

Fill Color

#ECECEC (light gray)

Border Radius

24px

Border Stroke

#E0E0E0, 1px

Shadow

#0000001A (subtle drop)

Padding

clamp(16px, 2vw, 24px)

Gap Between Items

clamp(8px, 1.2vw, 16px





This always looks the same ‚Äî it‚Äôs a visual class, not a layout-specific object.



‚∏ª



üîΩ Then in Context:



‚ÄúOn this screen, we‚Äôre placing a GRB inside the WBC.

Its width is 100% of WBC minus padding, height is auto.

It holds radio selectors and labels, but it doesn‚Äôt care what‚Äôs inside.‚Äù



We can call this usage:



WBC > GRB (used for Bureau/Creditor Radio Group)



That preserves:

‚Ä¢ Reusability

‚Ä¢ Separation of structure from instance

‚Ä¢ Clean tokens



‚∏ª



‚úÖ Let‚Äôs Rethink Naming System Accordingly

Code

Name

Type

Description

WBC

Whitebox Container

Layout Context

Specific to sidebar white container

GRB

Generic Rounded Box

Universal Type

A reusable inner box with radius, fill, border

RDB

Radio Button Circle

Universal Type

Style for any radio circle

LBL

Label Text

Universal Type

Paired with RDB or other input

SBH

Sidebar Heading

Universal Type

Applies in any WBC/Sidebar block





And on a layout spec, you‚Äôd define:



Inside WBC:

  - Insert GRB

    - Context: Bureau Selection

    - Width: 100%

    - Margin-bottom: 24px

    - Contains: RDB √ó 3 + LBL √ó 3





‚∏ª



üîÅ In Summary



You are correct:

We must separate:

1. What a thing is (visual design style ‚Äî universal)

2. Where and how it‚Äôs used (layout-specific instance)



And yes ‚Äî that is exactly what I meant earlier when I said you‚Äôd be building a universal layout system driven by tokens and reusable components.



We just had to catch ourselves before falling back into page-specific naming again.



‚∏ª



‚úÖ Next Steps



Would you like me to:

1. Rename BSB to GRB and recast it as a universal token/component

2. Go back and audit any other instance-specific names that should be promoted to universal

3. Create a dual-layer spec format:

‚Ä¢ Layer 1 = Universal Components Table

‚Ä¢ Layer 2 = Page Layout Context Table



You‚Äôre building this right. Let‚Äôs get the structure locked in once ‚Äî permanently.



David‚Äôs response 



So the same would be true for the heading. I forget what it's called, but the three code for the heading that could be used in any sidebar. I don't know if there's even two types because one of them has a different color for the number. That's for you to sort out. So do you want me to give you the PNG all over again and we start over?



Chat‚Äôs response 



No need to resend the PNG ‚Äî I already have the file and can continue working from it. But yes, you‚Äôre absolutely right again ‚Äî and we should reclassify the heading the same way we just did for the container box.



‚∏ª



‚úÖ Clarifying the Heading Logic



üí° What You‚Äôre Saying (Correctly):

‚Ä¢ The heading is not just for Viotagger

‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs a universal component used in multiple places

‚Ä¢ It might have variants ‚Äî like one with a red number, one without



‚∏ª



üÜï Let‚Äôs Redefine the Heading System

Inside WBC:

  - SHD-NUM (e.g. ‚Äú1. select bureau‚Ä¶‚Äù)

  - GRB container (for RDB + LBL radio sets)

  - SHD-NUM (e.g. ‚Äú2. select a report page‚Ä¶‚Äù)





‚∏ª



‚úÖ Do We Need to Start Over?



Nope. We just needed to restructure the taxonomy ‚Äî and we‚Äôve now done that. Your PNG is still perfectly valid, and we‚Äôll now treat it as a layout instance using universal components like:

‚Ä¢ WBC (Whitebox Container)

‚Ä¢ GRB (Generic Rounded Box)

‚Ä¢ RDB (Radio Circle)

‚Ä¢ LBL (Label Text)

‚Ä¢ SHD, SHD-NUM (Sidebar Headings)



‚∏ª



üîú Next Steps?



Would you like me to:

1. Rebuild a universal spec sheet (clean slate, component-first) with GRB, SHD, etc.?

2. Reconstruct the layout spec for the uploaded PNG using only the new universal names?

3. Build a visual key showing these universal items marked up on the image?



You nailed the core idea here. Let‚Äôs move forward with precision ‚Äî permanently.
