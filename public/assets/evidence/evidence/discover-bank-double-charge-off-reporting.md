Discover Bank ‚Äì Double Charge-Off Reporting
(Dec 2023 & Jan 2024)
Discover Bank reported two Charge-Offs: one before and one after the bankruptcy discharge
Summary
This document shows that Discover Bank reported my account as ‚ÄúCharge-Off‚Äù twice: once on December 31, 2023, and again post-discharge on January 31, 2024. The second report lists a $23,816 balance ‚Äî despite the account being discharged. This may constitute a serious FCRA violation and supports the case that Discover misreported one of the highest liabilities in my credit profile.

Additionally, this activity appeared in the Best Egg Damaging Activity Email on January 17, 2024 ‚Äî directly confirming that the reporting triggered real-time alerts and credit harm warnings to lenders and monitoring services.

FCRA Relevance
This evidence supports legal violations under FCRA ¬ß1681s-2(a)(1)(A) and ¬ß1681e(b). It demonstrates a repeated failure to report accurate post-discharge information and shows ongoing derogatory reporting that could mislead creditors. The tie to external alerts strengthens the claim of actual impact.

Timeline Placement
üî¥ Post-Discharge ‚Äì The second Charge-Off occurred after the bankruptcy discharge date of February 9, 2024.

Harm Index
üî¥ Severe ‚Äì High-value balance falsely reported post-discharge, duplicate Charge-Off reporting*
