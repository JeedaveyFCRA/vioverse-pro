Rocket Mortgage Credit Upgrade Referral – Impact Statement
Detailing the Financial and Emotional Consequences of Constructive Denial
Key Facts:
• Date of Referral: April 21, 2024
• Credit Score at Time: 600 (TransUnion)
• Required Score: 640
• Financial Requirement: $10,000 debt payoff
• Lost Opportunity: $23,000 refinance at ~$1,000/month savings
• Root Cause: 13 creditors misreporting discharged debts
Financial Impact
On April 21, 2024, Rocket Mortgage's conditional referral to their Credit Upgrade Department created an insurmountable financial barrier. Despite having a confirmed bankruptcy discharge and demonstrating creditworthiness through:

Timely post-bankruptcy payments
A previous credit score of 684 (2023)
Willingness to pay $737 for required repairs
I was denied access to market-rate financing due to a 107-point TransUnion score drop caused exclusively by creditor reporting errors. This constructive denial:

Forced continuation of high-interest debt payments ($1,000+/month)
Blocked consolidation of $23,000 in dischargeable obligations
Prevented critical home improvements (garage replacement)
Resulted in lost contractor deposits and preparation costs
Emotional and Personal Consequences
The ongoing financial strain precipitated by this referral has caused:

Marital stress from financial limitations and hidden shame
Social withdrawal due to inability to participate in activities
Health deterioration including stress-related weight gain
Career impacts from reduced professional confidence
Housing instability as needed repairs were deferred
FCRA Violations Documented
This event directly demonstrates violations of:

15 U.S.C. §1681e(b) - Failure to maintain reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy
15 U.S.C. §1681i(a) - Failure to conduct reasonable reinvestigation of disputed information
15 U.S.C. §1681s-2(a) - Furnishers' duty to provide accurate information
The documented harm directly correlates to these violations, with quantifiable damages exceeding $12,000 annually in unnecessary interest payments alone.

Conclusion
This referral was not a routine credit decision, but the direct result of systemic reporting failures. The consequences have been both financially quantifiable and personally devastating. The evidence demonstrates clear causation between creditor violations and:

The 107-point credit score drop
The constructive denial of refinancing
The ongoing financial and emotional harm
This document serves as both a personal narrative and evidentiary record of the damages incurred.
