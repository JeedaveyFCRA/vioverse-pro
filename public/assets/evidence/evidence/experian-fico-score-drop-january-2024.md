Experian FICO Score Drop â€“ January 2024
Sudden post-confirmation decline, triggering alerts and adverse actions
Summary
This document shows a significant 41-point drop in my Experian FICO score in January 2024, bringing it to 596. This occurred immediately after my Chapter 13 bankruptcy case was temporarily reopened for administrative reasons, even though the discharge was already pending. The drop coincided with the appearance of damaging tradeline activity, which triggered alerts and future credit denials.

FCRA Relevance
This score drop highlights the downstream impact of creditor misreporting and bureau data handling failures. It supports violations of FCRA Â§1681e(b) (failure to ensure maximum accuracy) and Â§1681i (failure to reinvestigate). The presence of negative entries at this sensitive stage led to cascading financial harm, including denied applications and increased interest rates.

Timeline Placement
ðŸŸ  Post-Confirmation (Late Stage) â€” Occurred just weeks before my official bankruptcy discharge on February 9, 2024.

Harm Index
