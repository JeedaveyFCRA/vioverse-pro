Rocket Mortgage Denial â€“ April 2024
Refinance blocked due to inaccurate credit history and suppressed post-discharge score
Summary
This document confirms that Rocket Mortgage was unable to offer refinance options in April 2024 due to a reported credit score of 600 and inaccurate negative information, including delinquency and bankruptcy-related issues. Despite progress in rebuilding credit, the score remained too low, blocking refinance approval.

FCRA Relevance
This denial supports claims under FCRA Â§1681e(b) and Â§1681i for failure to report accurate post-bankruptcy information and failure to reinvestigate disputed entries that suppressed the score. It also supports harm claims due to suppressed access to credit caused by misreporting from multiple furnishers.

Timeline Placement
ðŸ”´ This document belongs in the Post-Discharge Phase. The refinance denial occurred after my February 9, 2024 Chapter 13 discharge, during efforts to rebuild credit and access fair lending opportunities.

ðŸ”´ Harm Index: Extreme â€“ Direct denial of refinance based on suppressed post-discharge score and credit report inaccuracies
