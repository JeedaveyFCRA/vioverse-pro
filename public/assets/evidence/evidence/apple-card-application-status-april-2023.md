Apple Card â€“ Application Status (April 19, 2023)
Apple Card TransUnion Score Report â€“ Pre-Discharge Benchmark

Summary
ðŸ“Š This document shows that as of April 19, 2023â€”while still in Chapter 13â€”my TransUnion credit score was 684. Although the application for Apple Card was denied, this score reflects clear signs of credit recovery during the repayment phase. It establishes a positive baseline just 10 months before my February 9, 2024 discharge and sharply contrasts with the 107-point drop that followed due to widespread post-discharge misreporting.

FCRA Relevance
ðŸ”µ This document may be referenced to demonstrate that my credit profile was stabilizing prior to discharge. The high TransUnion score supports claims that the severe decline seen in June 2024 (577) was not a continuation of prior poor credit, but the result of inaccurate and harmful post-discharge credit reporting by multiple creditors in violation of FCRA Â§1681e(b). It serves as a critical anchor in my credit recovery timeline.

ðŸ“Ž See [DS 2830 Critical Timeline Sequence](ds-2830-critical-timeline-sequence.md) for documentation of the 107-point drop from this 684 baseline to 577 following the administrative case reopening.

Timeline Placement
ðŸ”µ Post-confirmation â€“ This document falls within the repayment period of my Chapter 13 bankruptcy, approximately 10 months before my official discharge date. It reflects a key moment of financial stability and credit improvement.

Harm Index
ðŸŸ¢ Reference Only â€“ While this document does not reflect direct harm, it plays a vital role as a pre-discharge benchmark in proving that the 107-point score drop was not inevitable. It strengthens the causality argument for post-discharge reporting failures.*

*This classification may be re-evaluated based on its role in dispute letters or comparisons with post-discharge events.
