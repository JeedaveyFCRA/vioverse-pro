# üìÇ Full Context Access Instructions for Claude Code
This instruction set ensures Claude Code is aware of all required context, tools, and evidence sources for analyzing the FCRA case. **No relevant system, folder, or website module should be ignored**.

---

## üîì Full Website Integration: Do Not Skip

You have access to all frontend and backend components of the FCRA case website, including:

- ‚úÖ `report-canvas`: Dynamic viewer showing credit report images and violations
- ‚úÖ `violations-processed.json`: Contains all FCRA violation descriptions per code
- ‚úÖ `assets/reports/`: PNGs from all 3 bureaus for April 25, 2024 (all 13 creditors)
- ‚úÖ `VioTagger` data export: The CSV that defines bounding box overlays and FCRA code per PNG
- ‚úÖ `FCRA Viewer` logic and sidebar filters
- ‚úÖ `Violation Counter` system and classification by severity (Severe / Serious / Minor)

These modules are **not cosmetic** ‚Äî they are core to interpreting, proving, and organizing FCRA violations. Be sure to reference them when forming case findings or summaries.

## üìÅ MUD Folder Access (Master Unified Dossier)

You are authorized to access **all contents of the MUD directory**, including:

- `CASE-NARRATIVE/` ‚Üí Full written timeline of case events
- `CRITICAL_FINDINGS/` ‚Üí Documents confirming creditor misconduct
- `QUANTIFIABLE HARM-AND-SCORE-DAMAGE/` ‚Üí Credit score drops, denials, emotional harm
- `PATTERN-PROOF/` ‚Üí Cross-bureau systemic reporting failures
- `VIOLATION-TYPE-GROUPINGS/` ‚Üí Grouped evidence by FCRA code or type
- `INSTRUCTIONS/` ‚Üí Task prompts and transformation requests
- `med3-violation-key-reference/` ‚Üí Legacy violation patterns from MED-3

Use these documents to guide analysis, pattern recognition, and audit trail generation.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è OCR / Image Processing

If unable to natively parse the `assets/reports/*.png` images, rely on **VioTagger CSV overlays** to determine violation location, code, severity, and description. These overlays are guaranteed to match the visible credit report pages.

---

## üö´ Business Context: Ignore for Evaluation

This evaluation should **focus solely on the evidence, violations, and regulatory patterns**. Any business branding, commercial plans, or product development (e.g. VioVerse trademarks) are **not relevant** to your legal or technical assessment.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

You must:

- Reference the website, canvas, sidebar, and overlay systems
- Explore every MUD subfolder
- Respect and apply all tagged violations and evidence groupings
- Ignore commercial aspects
- Treat all material as core to legal analysis and FCRA enforcement

Failure to consider any of these components will result in an incomplete or invalid evaluation.
