Subject: Emotional and Financial Impact of False Credit Reporting - Account xxxxxx7849

Dear Citizens Bank,

I, David V. Marra, am submitting this statement to document the severe emotional and financial distress caused by your inaccurate credit reporting following my Chapter 13 bankruptcy discharge on February 9, 2024.

1. Strategic Cessation Without Correction

Since my bankruptcy discharge, Citizens Bank maintained false reporting of my account ending in 7849 as "INCLUDED_IN_CHAPTER_13" on Equifax before strategically ceasing all credit reporting. This pattern of reporting violations followed by sudden cessation without correction has caused significant harm:

- Your account showed active bankruptcy status months after my February 9, 2024 discharge
- You ceased reporting across all bureaus by 2025 without ever correcting the false status
- Your account aged off per FCRA §1681c(a) 7-year reporting limits while still containing harmful inaccuracies
- Both Citizens accounts (7849 and 8116) reached their reporting time limits simultaneously based on similar delinquency dates

Your failure to correct these errors during the entire 7-year reporting period left me to suffer the consequences of your inaccurate reporting.

2. Contribution to Systematic Credit Suppression

Your false reporting, combined with similar violations from 12 other creditors, created a cascade of financial barriers:

April 23, 2024 & November 22, 2024: Best Egg denied my loan applications, citing high debt-to-income ratios inflated by accounts like yours falsely showing active bankruptcy status.

January 2025: Capital One denied my credit line increase request, specifically citing "too many seriously delinquent or derogatory obligations" from my Equifax credit report - the same bureau where you reported false information.

Your shorter violation period followed by cessation does not diminish the harm - it demonstrates violations of FCRA obligations by ceasing to report rather than correcting errors.

3. Regulatory Oversight and Enhanced Obligations

As a state-chartered bank subject to New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) oversight, Citizens Bank has heightened obligations to New York consumers. Your pattern of false reporting followed by cessation without correction raises serious regulatory compliance concerns that extend beyond FCRA to state consumer protection laws.

4. Emotional and Ongoing Financial Impact

The cumulative effect of your misreporting, particularly when multiplied across two accounts, has caused:
- Severe anxiety about my financial future and creditworthiness
- Frustration from being penalized for debts legally discharged in bankruptcy
- Ongoing higher interest rates on approved credit due to suppressed scores
- Lost opportunities from credit denials directly tied to false reporting

Your decision to cease reporting without correction leaves me in limbo - unable to dispute non-existent tradelines while still suffering from the damage you caused.

4a. Compounded Harm from Administrative Bankruptcy Reopening

The emotional impact of your false reporting was severely amplified by administrative requirements following my discharge. My bankruptcy case was briefly reopened in January 2024 solely to file Form DS 2830 (Domestic Support Obligation Form)—a routine administrative filing required for bankruptcy completion. This was NOT due to any payment issues or non-compliance on my part.

During this brief administrative window, multiple creditors including Citizens Bank began reporting negative information, causing my TransUnion score to plummet 107 points. The timing of your negative reporting during this procedural reopening has caused disproportionate and unnecessary harm that continues to suppress my credit scores.

4b. Ongoing Credit Score Suppression Despite Discharge

Despite my diligent efforts to rebuild my credit following the February 9, 2024 discharge, your continued misreporting has prevented meaningful score recovery:
• Pre-discharge credit scores: Above 620 across all bureaus
• Immediate post-discharge drop: 107 points on TransUnion alone
• Current scores (February 2025): Still suppressed at 596, classified as "Very Poor"
• Duration of suppression: Over 12 months and continuing

This sustained suppression—directly caused by your failure to properly update discharged accounts—prevents me from achieving the fresh start guaranteed by bankruptcy law. The administrative DS 2830 filing should never have triggered negative reporting, yet your actions during that window continue to damage my financial recovery.

5. Request for Accountability and Remediation

I respectfully request that Citizens Bank:
1. Acknowledge the harm caused by false reporting followed by strategic cessation
2. Work with credit bureaus to ensure any residual impact from your misreporting is fully remediated
3. Compensate me for the financial and emotional harm caused by your failure to accurately report my account status as required by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)
4. Implement procedures to prevent strategic cessation without correction in response to bankruptcy discharges
5. Acknowledge the compounded harm caused by reporting errors during the DS 2830 administrative filing period and the ongoing suppression of my credit scores despite 12+ months passing since discharge

The pattern of brief violations followed by exit without correction suggests a calculated approach to minimize liability while maximizing consumer harm. This conduct violates both federal FCRA requirements and the consumer protection standards expected of New York state-chartered financial institutions.

I certify that the above statement is true and accurate to the best of my knowledge.


Sincerely,


David V. Marra
