Best Egg Denial â€“ April 23, 2024
Credit denial following false delinquency reporting in pre-discharge period
Summary
This notice from Best Egg, dated April 23, 2024, states that my application was denied due to serious delinquency, excessive balances, and derogatory public records. The credit score used was 632 (Experian), which reflects the damage caused by inaccurate credit reporting in the months leading up to my bankruptcy discharge. The denial confirms that key factors such as "public record," "high utilization," and "number of delinquencies" were still affecting lending decisions.

FCRA Relevance
This document supports ongoing harm caused by violations of FCRA Â§1681e(b) (failure to maintain maximum accuracy) and potentially FCRA Â§1681s-2(a) (continued false reporting post-confirmation). The denial aligns with other negative outcomes in early 2024, showing a pattern of credit suppression tied to creditor misreporting.

Timeline Placement
ðŸ”´ Post-Discharge (Early) â€“ Discharge occurred February 9, 2024. This denial occurred 2.5 months later.

Harm Index
ðŸ”´ Severe â€“ Direct denial of credit after discharge, citing issues stemming from pre-discharge misreporting
