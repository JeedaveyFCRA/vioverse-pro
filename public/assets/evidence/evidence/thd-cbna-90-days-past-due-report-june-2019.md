THD/CBNA â€“ 90 Days Past Due Report (June 2019)
Old delinquency potentially misused in later scoring models
Summary
This document shows a 90-day delinquency reported by THD/CBNA on June 13, 2019. While this date predates the Chapter 13 bankruptcy, the delinquency may still be affecting credit risk models due to continued inclusion in credit history calculations.

FCRA Relevance
While pre-bankruptcy delinquencies may be legally reportable, they must be accurate and not misleading. If the status was not updated correctly during or after the bankruptcy, it could violate FCRA Â§1681e(b) for continued inaccuracy.

Timeline Placement
ðŸŸ¡ Pre-confirmation â€“ Reported well before bankruptcy filing and repayment plan initiation.

Harm Index
ðŸŸ¡ Low â€“ Legacy delinquency with minimal standalone impact, but may compound other negative factors
