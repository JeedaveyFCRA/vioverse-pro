Bankruptcy record from Experian report downloaded via annualcreditreport.com on February 10, 2025 (Page 32)
Summary
This document captures the Experian public record section from the February 10, 2025 credit report PDF. It reflects David Marra’s Chapter 13 bankruptcy, noting that it was discharged on February 9, 2024. However, there is a delay in updating the "discharged" status across the records, which has resulted in ongoing reporting issues.

FCRA Relevance
This document supports claims under FCRA §1681e(b) for failure to maintain maximum possible accuracy and §1681i(a) for reinvestigation obligations. Experian continues to misreport the bankruptcy status, showing it as unresolved or pending even after the discharge date.

Timeline Placement
🔴 Post-Discharge – This report was generated after the official discharge date of February 9, 2024.
