Summary
This document captures the Experian public record section from the March 13, 2025 credit report PDF. It continues to report David Marra’s Chapter 13 bankruptcy as “Dismissed/Closed” despite the plan being completed and the discharge finalized on February 9, 2024. The misreporting remains unchanged from prior reports, indicating systemic failure to update the bankruptcy status correctly.
