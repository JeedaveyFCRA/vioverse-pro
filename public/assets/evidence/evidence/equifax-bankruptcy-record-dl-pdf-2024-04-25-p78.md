Equifax – Bankruptcy Record – DL_PDF – 2024-04-25 – Page 78
Bankruptcy status listed as “Dismissed/Closed” instead of “Discharged” two months after discharge date
Summary
This is a scanned public record entry from Equifax showing how David Marra’s Chapter 13 bankruptcy was being reported as of April 25, 2024. The record fails to properly reflect the discharge granted in February 2024. It incorrectly lists the status as blank, and includes a prior disposition of “Chapter 13, Dismissed/Closed,” which is false and misleading given the discharge was finalized in February 2024. This version was pulled from the Equifax PDF download (DL_PDF), not the online portal.

FCRA Relevance
This document supports claims under FCRA §1681e(b) and §1681i(a). The reporting is materially inaccurate in two ways: (1) failure to include an updated bankruptcy status of “Discharged,” and (2) continued use of outdated language (“Dismissed/Closed”) implying the consumer is still liable for debts already discharged. This misreporting was visible to creditors as of April 2024 and supports David’s broader pattern of post-discharge damage.

Timeline Placement
🔴 Post-Discharge – Retrieved over two months after the February 9, 2024 discharge order.

Harm Index
🔴 Severe – Bankruptcy marked as dismissed/closed instead of discharged, implying continued liability to creditors.
