Mariner Finance â€“ Duplicate Charge-Off Reporting (Dec 2023 & Jan 2024)
Reported charge-offs both before and after the new year for the same $3,556 balance
Summary
This document shows two charge-off reports for the same Mariner Finance account: one on December 31, 2023, and another on January 31, 2024. Both list a balance of $3,556. This suggests the account was re-reported in close succession, which could inflate the appearance of ongoing delinquency.

FCRA Relevance
These reports may reflect issues under FCRA Â§1681s-2(a)(1)(A), which prohibits continued reporting of inaccurate or duplicative information. The second report also occurred just days before the bankruptcy discharge, which further complicates its accuracy and legality.

Timeline Placement
ðŸ”µ Post-confirmation (during repayment) â€” both reports occurred before the bankruptcy discharge on February 9, 2024.

Harm Index
ðŸŸ  Moderate â€“ Two charge-off reports in 30 days for same balance, pre-discharge
