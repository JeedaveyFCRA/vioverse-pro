Discover Personal Loans – Investigation Letter – 2025-03-28
Formal response letter confirming correction to credit report after initial denial
Summary
This document is a formal investigation response from Discover Personal Loans dated March 18, 2025. It confirms that Discover reviewed David Marra’s dispute and agreed to correct their reporting to reflect that the loan was “Discharged in Bankruptcy.” This letter is the final result of a lengthy process that began shortly after David’s Chapter 13 case was reopened and then discharged in early 2024.

📌 Why This Document Matters
This Discover investigation was the turning point that triggered David’s entire credit dispute campaign. After receiving a traumatic Best Egg “Damaging Activity” alert in January 2024 and watching his FICO scores collapse, David emailed his bankruptcy attorney Joseph DiMarco on February 8, 2024, urgently asking whether these derogatory reports were legal while his case was reopened. Soon after that, he contacted Discover to challenge the charge-off and seek a correction.

At that time, Discover stated—verbally—that they found no wrongdoing and would not update the report. Around the same time, Rocket Mortgage banker Jacob Dufurrena confirmed the damage caused by the Discover charge-off in an April 2024 email.

It wasn’t until David re-contacted Discover in March 2025 that this letter was issued—more than a year later—proving that a correction was warranted. This document not only shows that Discover had originally dismissed his concern, but also proves that the disputed reporting was inaccurate.

FCRA Relevance
This letter supports claims under FCRA §1681s-2(a)(1)(A) and §1681e(b). It shows that Discover initially failed to correct inaccurate post-bankruptcy reporting, then later acknowledged the mistake after a formal reinvestigation. The delay contributed to financial and emotional harm across 2024.

Timeline Placement
🟠 Post-Discharge Correction – Confirmed on March 18, 2025, but tied to disputes initiated shortly after discharge in February 2024.
