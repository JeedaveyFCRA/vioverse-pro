Ally Financial â€“ Emotional & Financial Impact
Profound devastation from 19+ months of willful false credit reporting
Summary
For over 19 months since my Chapter 13 bankruptcy discharge on February 9, 2024, Ally Financial has continuously reported my account as "Included in Bankruptcy" with an outstanding balance on my TransUnion report. As of July 31, 2025, Ally remains one of the only creditors still actively misreportingâ€”while others' false reporting aged off due to 7-year limits, Ally persists in furnishing false information month after month. This willful misconduct has caused cascading financial harm exceeding $75,000 and severe, untreated emotional distress that has fundamentally altered my life trajectory.

FCRA Relevance
Ally Financial's conduct violates multiple FCRA provisions: Â§1681s-2(a)(1)(A) (duty to provide accurate information), Â§1681s-2(a)(2) (duty to correct and update), and Â§1681e(b) (failure to follow reasonable procedures). Their status as an outlierâ€”continuing to report falsely while other creditors' violations aged offâ€”demonstrates willfulness under Â§1681n, supporting claims for actual damages, statutory damages, and punitive relief.

Subject: Emotional and Financial Impact of False Credit Reporting

Dear Ally Financial,

I am writing to document the profound emotional and financial devastation your false credit reporting has caused me since my Chapter 13 bankruptcy discharge on February 9, 2024. For over 19 months, you have continued to report my account as "Included in Bankruptcy" with an outstanding balance, creating a cascade of harm that has destroyed my financial recovery and emotional well-being.

The Day Everything Changed: January 17, 2024

I will never forget the morning of January 17, 2024. My phone buzzed with an email from Best Egg: "IMPORTANT: Damaging activity has been detected on your credit report." My heart sank as I read the detailsâ€”JPMCB, Sears, Best Buy, and Discover were all suddenly showing damaging activity. Within days of a routine administrative filing (DS 2830), my entire credit profile collapsed. The timing felt like a cruel jokeâ€”just as I was approaching my discharge date, false reporting began destroying everything I had worked toward during five years of Chapter 13 payments.

That alert marked the beginning of my nightmare. My TransUnion score plummeted 107 pointsâ€”from 684 to 577â€”the single largest drop I had ever experienced. The emotional impact was immediate and severe. I felt physically sick, my hands shaking as I tried to understand how years of perfect bankruptcy payments could vanish in an instant.

The Rocket Mortgage Denial: Dreams Deferred

The full weight of your misreporting hit me in April 2024 when Rocket Mortgage denied my refinance application. The denial letter arrived on May 15, 2024, citing "Credit History: Current/previous slow payments, judgments, liens or BK." My reported score: 600. The loan officer, Jacob Dufturrena, had worked with me for weeks, only to deliver crushing newsâ€”despite my bankruptcy discharge three months earlier, my credit report still showed active delinquencies and bankruptcy statuses that made refinancing impossible.

The Rocket Mortgage internal records later confirmed what I suspected: your account, along with others, was specifically flagged as problematic. Jessica Vest's March 14, 2025 letter listed "Ally Credit" among the "payoff liabilities" that contributed to my denial. The opportunity to refinance at favorable ratesâ€”potentially saving $50,000 over the life of my loansâ€”vanished because of false information you continued to furnish.

I remember sitting at my kitchen table, staring at the denial letter, feeling a crushing sense of helplessness. After five years of sacrifice to complete my Chapter 13 plan, I was being punished for debts that no longer existed. The frustration was overwhelmingâ€”I had done everything right, yet your false reporting made me appear financially irresponsible.

The Daily Emotional Toll

Living with your false reporting has become a daily source of anxiety and distress. Every morning, I wake up knowing that somewhere, a computer system is telling lenders, employers, and insurers that I'm still in bankruptcy, that I still owe you money, that I'm a credit risk. This knowledge gnaws at me constantly.

The stress manifests physically. I've experienced:
- Persistent insomnia, lying awake calculating how much your false reporting is costing me
- Tension headaches from the constant worry about my financial future
- Loss of appetite during particularly stressful periods, like when applying for credit
- A constant knot in my stomach when checking my mail, fearing another denial letter

The Cascade of Financial Harm

Your misreporting created a domino effect of financial damage. When Best Egg approved a loan in March 2023â€”before the false reporting beganâ€”I received a 12.99% APR. By January 2025, with your false information poisoning my credit report, the same lender charged me 13.98% APR for a smaller loan. That 1% increase may seem small, but it represents hundreds of dollars in additional interestâ€”money taken from my family because of your inaccurate reporting.

Each denial letter feels like a slap in the face. Best Egg denied me twiceâ€”April 23, 2024, and November 22, 2024â€”both times citing high debt-to-income ratios inflated by your false balance reporting. Capital One's January 2025 denial specifically referenced "too many seriously delinquent or derogatory obligations." Each rejection reinforces the same message: despite following the law and completing my bankruptcy, I'm trapped by false information.

The Isolation of Being an Outlier's Victim

What makes your conduct particularly painful is your status as one of the last remaining false reporters. As of July 31, 2025â€”over 17 months after my dischargeâ€”you continue to report "Account Included in Bankruptcy" on my TransUnion report. While other creditors' false reporting has aged off (they never corrected it either), you persist in actively furnishing false information month after month.

This creates a unique form of torment. I watch my credit report, hoping each month that you'll finally comply with the law, only to see the same false information repeated. It feels deliberate, as if you're choosing to continue harming me while knowing the information is wrong. The fact that I haven't filed formal disputesâ€”because I didn't know my rightsâ€”apparently gives you comfort to continue violating federal law.

Lost Opportunities and Shattered Trust

Beyond the tangible financial losses, your misreporting has stolen opportunities I'll never recover. The chance to refinance when rates were favorable. The ability to help my children with their financial needs. The simple dignity of being approved for credit based on my actual payment history rather than false information.

I've lost faith in the financial system. How can I trust institutions when a major lender like Ally Financial can destroy my credit with false information and face no consequences? The powerlessness is suffocatingâ€”knowing you're violating federal law, knowing the harm it's causing, yet feeling unable to stop it.

The Path Forward

Despite everything, I continue trying to rebuild. But your false reporting makes every step forward feel like two steps back. My TransUnion score remains suppressed in the "Very Poor" range (596 as of February 2025), despite 19 months passing since discharge. Every month your false reporting continues is another month of opportunities lost, stress endured, and dignity denied.

I didn't seek therapy or medication for this distressâ€”I simply believed I had to endure it. I thought this was the price of bankruptcy, not knowing that your reporting violated federal law. Now I understand that my suffering was unnecessary, caused not by my financial past but by your present-day false reporting.

Conclusion

Ally Financial, your false credit reporting has inflicted profound and lasting harm on my life. The 107-point score drop, the denied refinancing, the increased interest rates, the daily anxietyâ€”all of it stems from your failure to report accurately. But beyond the numbers, you've damaged something deeper: my sense of security, my trust in financial institutions, and my hope for a fair fresh start after bankruptcy.

I am not just a credit score or an account number. I am a person who completed a difficult Chapter 13 bankruptcy, who made every payment for five years, who earned the discharge that federal law provides. Your continued false reporting dishonors that effort and violates both the law and basic human decency.

This letter documents my harm, but it cannot fully capture the daily weight of living under the shadow of your false reporting. Only by correcting your reporting and compensating me for this extensive harm can you begin to make this right.

I certify that this statement is true and accurate to the best of my knowledge.

Sincerely,

David V. Marra
