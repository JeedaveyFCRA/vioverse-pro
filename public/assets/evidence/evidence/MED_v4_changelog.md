# Master-Evidence-Data v4 Changelog

## Date: June 16, 2025
## Upgrade from v3 to v4

### Overview
Master-Evidence-Data_v4.csv has been created with 5 new analytical columns designed to identify systemic patterns and longitudinal FCRA violations across time and bureaus.

### New Columns Added

#### 1. High Balance Misreporting (TU)
- **Logic**: TRUE if TransUnion balance > $0 and account shows "Included in Bankruptcy"
- **Purpose**: Identifies TransUnion's unique pattern of maintaining high balances on bankruptcy-included accounts
- **Results**: 6 creditors show this pattern:
  - Ally Financial: High Balance $20,283
  - Barclays: High Balance $2,002
  - JPM/CB: High Balance $742
  - THD/CBNA: High Balance $510
  - Mariner Finance: High Balance $4,039
  - Cornerstone FCU: High Balance $524

#### 2. Creditor Ceased Reporting
- **Logic**: TRUE if creditor is no longer present in 2025 but was present in 2024 reports
- **Purpose**: Tracks "exit patterns" suggesting consciousness of guilt or systematic withdrawal
- **Key Findings**: 
  - Barclays: Ceased reporting
  - JPM/CB: Ceased reporting
  - THD/CBNA: Ceased reporting
  - Mariner Finance: Ceased reporting
  - Bank of America: Ceased reporting
  - Discover Bank: Ceased reporting
  - Sears/CBNA: Ceased reporting
  - Best Buy/CBNA: Ceased reporting
  - Citizens Bank (both accounts): Ceased reporting

#### 3. Systemic Equifax Violation
- **Logic**: TRUE for all creditors reporting "INCLUDED_IN_CHAPTER_13" on Equifax post-discharge
- **Purpose**: Identifies Equifax's bureau-wide failure to update bankruptcy statuses
- **Results**: 12 out of 13 creditors show this violation pattern

#### 4. Cross-Bureau Conflict
- **Logic**: TRUE if same creditor shows different statuses across EQ, EX, TU
- **Purpose**: Proves absence of reasonable procedures when creditors report inconsistently
- **Key Findings**: Most creditors with ceased reporting also show cross-bureau conflicts

#### 5. Violation Duration (Months)
- **Logic**: Count of report cycles where violations persisted
- **Purpose**: Quantifies temporal harm and willfulness through duration
- **Results**: 
  - Most creditors show 5-6 month violation durations
  - Indicates violations persisted from April 2024 through March 2025

### Summary of Systemic Patterns Identified

1. **Equifax Bureau-Wide Failure**: 92% of creditors show improper "INCLUDED_IN_CHAPTER_13" status
2. **Mass Exit Pattern**: 69% of creditors ceased reporting in 2025
3. **Cross-Bureau Inconsistency**: Widespread conflicts in reporting across bureaus
4. **Prolonged Violations**: Average 5-6 month duration of uncorrected violations

### Technical Notes
- Original MED v3 preserved at: Master-Evidence-Data_v3.csv
- New file created at: Master-Evidence-Data_v4.csv
- Total records: 13 creditors
- New columns: 5 (columns 56-60)

### Recommendation
These new columns provide crucial evidence for:
- Proving willful violations through duration and pattern analysis
- Demonstrating bureau-specific systemic failures
- Identifying creditor consciousness of guilt through exit patterns
- Quantifying cross-bureau reporting failures
