Bankruptcy record from Equifax report downloaded via annualcreditreport.com on February 10, 2025 (Page 67)
Summary
This page from the February 10, 2025 Equifax credit report shows continued public record reporting of David Marra’s Chapter 13 bankruptcy. The primary issue is the inclusion of contradictory or misleading status language such as “Dismissed/Closed,” which is not accurate following the February 9, 2024 discharge order.

FCRA Relevance
This reporting is a violation of FCRA §1681e(b), which requires credit furnishers to ensure maximum possible accuracy. As of this report date, the bankruptcy had been fully discharged. Continued use of outdated terms like “Dismissed/Closed” or leaving the “Status” field blank implies unresolved liability and contributes to lower credit scores and adverse credit decisions.

Timeline Placement
🟠 Post-Discharge — This report was downloaded the day after discharge (February 10, 2025) and shows failure to immediately reflect accurate public record status.

Harm Index
🔴 Moderate–Severe — Outdated or ambiguous bankruptcy status creates confusion for creditors and contributes to prolonged credit harm after discharge.
