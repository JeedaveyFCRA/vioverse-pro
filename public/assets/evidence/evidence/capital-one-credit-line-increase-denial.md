Capital One – Credit Line Increase Denial
Denial issued January 20, 2025, citing Equifax derogatories and recent usage factors
Summary
This document shows that Capital One denied my request for a credit line increase on January 20, 2025. The denial was based in part on my Equifax credit report, which allegedly contained “too many seriously delinquent or derogatory credit obligations.” This directly ties to the inaccurate post-bankruptcy entries still present in my file. The denial also cited low account usage and low payment amounts, despite a solid payment history over time.

FCRA Relevance
This denial reinforces that inaccurate or outdated derogatory entries on my Equifax report—specifically from creditors who failed to update after my bankruptcy—had a direct and adverse impact on my access to credit. This supports claims of negligent or willfully inaccurate reporting under FCRA §§ 1681e(b), 1681s-2(a), and 1681i.

Timeline Placement
🔴 Post-Discharge (Late Stage) – Occurred nearly one year after bankruptcy discharge (Feb 9, 2024), proving that the impact of erroneous reporting remained active and harmful into 2025.

Harm Index
🟠 Moderate – Financial access denied due to lingering credit report derogatories tied to FCRA violations
