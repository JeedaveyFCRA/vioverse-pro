Equifax_PublicRecord_DL_ONL
Online Equifax public record snapshot from myEquifax portal (DL_ONL), showing bankruptcy record as of August 19, 2024
Summary
This is the online version of the Equifax public record section (“DL_ONL”) retrieved from the myEquifax.com portal. It confirms that Equifax was still reporting David Marra’s Chapter 13 bankruptcy as of August 19, 2024, with limited detail and no updated status. The record lacks necessary corrections expected after discharge, including a missing status field and empty liability/exempt/asset data.

FCRA Relevance
This online public record snapshot supports claims under FCRA §1681e(b) and §1681i(a)(5)(A). The record confirms Equifax’s failure to ensure “maximum possible accuracy,” as required, and reveals insufficient information or status updates following the Chapter 13 discharge in February 2024. It also provides confirmation that the record remained visible to the public and potential creditors as of August 2024.

Timeline Placement
🟠 Post-Discharge Monitoring — Captured on August 19, 2024, more than 6 months after the official bankruptcy discharge.

Harm Index
🟠 Moderate – Confirms continued public listing of bankruptcy without status resolution, contributing to denial risks.
