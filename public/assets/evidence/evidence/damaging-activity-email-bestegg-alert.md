Damaging Activity Email – BestEgg-Alert
Credit alert triggered by Best Egg on January 17, 2024 listing multiple overdue or damaging accounts tied to TransUnion
Summary
This document is a financial health alert email from Best Egg, sent on January 17, 2024. It warned of “damaging activity” appearing on my credit report via TransUnion, including overdue payments or derogatory remarks for Discover Bank, JPMCB, Sears/CBNA, and Best Buy/CBNA. The message arrived within days of my Chapter 13 bankruptcy case being administratively closed and caused significant emotional distress. This email supports my claims of reputational and psychological harm stemming from creditor misreporting before the discharge was finalized.

FCRA Relevance

The appearance of derogatory data after court closure and during the discharge process shows a harmful delay or failure to correct the record. [Draft – pending final legal narrative]

Explanation from David Marra:
Within days of my Chapter 13 bankruptcy case being temporarily closed for administrative reasons, I received this alert showing major derogatory events were being reported to TransUnion. It triggered a sharp credit score drop (estimated 100+ points) and caused significant emotional distress as it appeared my entire repayment history had been wiped or ignored by creditors. These types of alerts from Best Egg and others have continued since that time.
