Best Egg Denial â€“ November 22, 2024
Loan application denied based on Experian report and high debt-to-income ratio
Summary
This letter from Best Egg, dated November 22, 2024, confirms denial of my loan application due to a high debt-to-income ratio and credit score issues. The credit score used was 659 from Experian. The document shows direct causality between inaccurate reporting and my inability to access credit, even after years of rebuilding post-bankruptcy.

FCRA Relevance
This adverse action ties directly to information reported by Experian, reinforcing the connection between credit report violations and real-world harm. The denial cites score suppression factors traceable to unresolved or inaccurately reported derogatory data. It supports claims under FCRA Â§1681e(b) for failure to ensure maximum possible accuracy.

Timeline Placement
ðŸ”´ Post-Discharge (Late 2024) â€” Nearly 10 months after discharge, indicating ongoing harm from uncorrected reporting errors.

Harm Index
ðŸŸ  Moderate â€“ Loan denial with suppressed score and documented reason tied to credit report data

Denial Reason:
The income is insufficient to manage the incremental total debts.
If a consumer has insufficient income to manage the current total debts, it means that a consumer has a high debt-to-income ratio, which indicates the consumer may not be able to pay back the debt on a new credit account.
