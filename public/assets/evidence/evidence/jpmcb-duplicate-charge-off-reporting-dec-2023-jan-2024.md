JPMCB ‚Äì Duplicate Charge-Off Reporting (Dec 2023 & Jan 2024)
JPMCB reported the same charge-off twice, straddling the bankruptcy discharge date
Summary
This document shows two charge-off reports by JPMCB Card Services. The first was dated December 20, 2023, and the second occurred nearly one month later on January 19, 2024 ‚Äî just three weeks before my bankruptcy discharge. Both reports show a balance of $742 and may suggest re-reporting of the same debt, escalating harm and misrepresentation of account status. This harmful reporting was later flagged in a Best Egg ‚ÄúDamaging Activity‚Äù email alert on January 17, 2024, confirming the emotional and financial damage it caused.

FCRA Relevance
These reports raise potential concerns under FCRA ¬ß1681s-2(a)(1)(A) and ¬ß1681e(b). The repeated charge-off activity could have misled creditors and contributed to adverse decisions, especially with the account in an active bankruptcy proceeding. The January 17, 2024 email alert from Best Egg independently flagged JPMCB as a source of damaging credit activity, reinforcing the evidence of harm caused by this inaccurate reporting.

Timeline Placement
üîµ Post-confirmation (during repayment) ‚Äî both reports occurred while my Chapter 13 plan was still active, prior to discharge.

Harm Index
üü† Moderate ‚Äì Duplicate derogatory reporting before discharge, with unresolved balance
