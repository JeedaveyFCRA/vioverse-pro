Credit Report & Public Record Discrepancy Analysis
Comprehensive review of credit bureau reporting errors post-Chapter 13 discharge (February 9, 2024)
Summary
This analysis reveals significant discrepancies in how TransUnion, Equifax, and Experian are reporting accounts included in my Chapter 13 bankruptcy (filed 10/25/2018, discharged 02/09/2024). While Experian correctly shows most accounts as discharged, TransUnion and Equifax continue to report accounts as "Included in Bankruptcy" without discharge status, with outdated "Date Updated" fields (some as old as 2017), and in some cases showing incorrect balances. The public record comparison shows all bureaus acknowledge the bankruptcy filing, but only Experian and TransUnion explicitly confirm the discharge date.

FCRA Relevance
These reporting errors violate multiple FCRA provisions: §1681e(b) (accuracy requirements), §1681s-2(a) (furnisher responsibilities), and §1681i (dispute investigation requirements). The frozen tradelines with outdated information create a misleading representation of creditworthiness, particularly harmful after discharge when creditors should see a clean slate. The missing discharge notations could lead to improper denials of credit or unfavorable terms.

Timeline Placement
🔴 Post-Discharge (Phase 3) – These reports were pulled nearly 14 months after discharge, demonstrating persistent inaccuracies that should have been corrected during the dispute process following discharge.

Harm Index
🔴 Severe – Systemic reporting failures across multiple bureaus and creditors, with direct impact on creditworthiness assessment post-discharge
