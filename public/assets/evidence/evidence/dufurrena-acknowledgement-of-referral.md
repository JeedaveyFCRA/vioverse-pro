Dufurrena Acknowledgement of Referral
Internal email from Rocket Mortgage banker acknowledging Discover charge-off damage
Summary
This document contains a direct email from Jacob Dufurrena, a senior banker at Rocket Mortgage, sent on April 23, 2024. He acknowledges that a Discover Bank charge-off was damaging Davidâ€™s credit and interfering with his ability to refinance. This message confirms that the charge-off was a known factor during the refinance process and supports Davidâ€™s claim of harm and urgency in pursuing a resolution.

Why This Document Matters
Jacobâ€™s email was one of the first confirmations from a lender that the Discover charge-off was harming Davidâ€™s credit. This correspondence helped validate the urgency behind contacting Discover, opening a credit dispute, and ultimately launching the broader FCRA investigation. It directly supports the events described in the Discover Investigation Letter.

FCRA Relevance
This email supports Davidâ€™s claim that Discover Bankâ€™s inaccurate credit reporting had a measurable impact on his creditworthiness. It establishes a timeline of harm and corroborates that the information reported on his credit report influenced major financial decisions â€” such as his mortgage refinance attempt. This bolsters claims under FCRA Â§1681e(b) and Â§1681s-2(a)(1)(A).

Timeline Placement
ðŸŸ  Post-confirmation (after case reopened) â€” sent April 23, 2024, two months after the bankruptcy discharge and after David had initiated dispute efforts.

Hi David,

I received your voicemail and I wanted to make sure I returned the correspondence same day, but I realize it's almost 10pm there, so I figured an email is more appropriate than a phone call.

The Discover charge-off thing is unfortunate, but there's a silver-lining, because once they correct that, it should immediately correct your scores, without you needing to pay down balances on your own. Fingers crossed, it doesn't take them long to fix it.

Please keep me posted as updates come.

Warm regards,
Jacob Dufurrena
President's Club Banker, Rocket Mortgage
