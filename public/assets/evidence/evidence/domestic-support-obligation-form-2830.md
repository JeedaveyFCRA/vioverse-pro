Domestic Support Obligation Form 2830
Required form to finalize bankruptcy discharge and avoid case dismissal
Summary
This document is a formal request from David Marra‚Äôs bankruptcy attorney, dated November 16, 2023, urging him to submit the required Domestic Support Obligation Form (Form 2830). Without submitting this form, the court would be forced to close the Chapter 13 case without a discharge ‚Äî requiring David to reopen the case and pay additional legal and court fees. This delay ultimately contributed to negative credit reporting in January 2024 before the discharge was finalized.

FCRA Relevance
This form provides critical context for the period of reopened bankruptcy activity in early 2024. It establishes that David‚Äôs case was administratively reopened solely to file this form. Any creditor reporting a ‚Äúdismissed‚Äù status or other derogatory information during this window may be in violation of FCRA ¬ß1681s-2(a)(1)(A) and ¬ß1681e(b), since the discharge was legally in process and not reversed.

Timeline Placement
üü† Pre-Discharge / Administrative Reopening ‚Äî November 2023 form deadline; case reopened January 2024; discharge finalized February 9, 2024.

Harm Index
üü† Moderate ‚Äì Delayed discharge enabled inaccurate credit reporting in early 2024.

Subject: Urgent Notice Regarding Bankruptcy Discharge

Dear David:

You are receiving this notice because you have not yet completed one of the steps necessary to obtain your bankruptcy discharge. If you are a married couple filing jointly, each of you must complete a form.

Please Complete and Mail Back the Attached Domestic Support Obligation Form.

This form indicates that you have no unpaid domestic support obligation since the filing of your bankruptcy case. It is required of ALL Chapter 13 cases, whether or not you have ever owed alimony or child support.

The failure to file the Domestic Support Obligation form with the Court will result in the closing of your case without a discharge of your debts. If this happens, you can only obtain a discharge by re-opening the case. This will result in fees to the Court of $235 and legal fees to our office of $500. Please give this your immediate attention. You may return this form by mail, fax (716-853-1378), or email it to nmacartney@grubealaw.com.
