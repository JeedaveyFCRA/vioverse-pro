TransUnion Public Record â€“ Bankruptcy Discharge â€“ Page 2
Repeat public record listing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, shown on March 13, 2025 credit report PDF
Summary
This public record excerpt from TransUnion shows the continued listing of a discharged Chapter 13 bankruptcy. The entry reflects outdated and redundant information more than a year after the official discharge date, still appearing in the public records section of a March 2025 report.

FCRA Relevance
This document supports violations of 15 U.S.C. Â§1681e(b) and Â§1681c, confirming TransUnion continues to report the bankruptcy status in ways that may mislead lenders or credit decision systems well after the discharge.

Timeline Placement
ðŸ”´ Post-Discharge (Late Phase) â€“ This record appears over a year after the Chapter 13 was legally discharged and long after accurate status updates were due.

Harm Index
ðŸ”´ Extreme Harm â€“ The repeated public display of the bankruptcy in March 2025 increases reputational damage, affects lender perception, and shows potential systemic failure to remove outdated information.
