Rocket Mortgage â€“ Internal Credit Documents â€“ March 2025
Internal underwriting findings showing referral due to bankruptcy and credit score issues
Summary
This document contains internal credit evaluation materials from Rocket Mortgage regarding a refinance application submitted by David Marra. The underwriting system flagged the application due to the bankruptcy reporting and referred it for manual review. The document also shows a credit score of 600 from Experian and includes specific debt verification notes that impacted eligibility and processing.

FCRA Relevance
This evidence directly supports a violation of 15 U.S.C. Â§1681e(b) and Â§1681s-2(a) by demonstrating how incorrect or outdated bankruptcy reporting resulted in a referral for manual underwriting. The document shows the applicantâ€™s credit report was used in loan decisioning and affected access to refinancing opportunities.

Timeline Placement
ðŸ”´ Post-Discharge (Mid Stage) â€“ March 2025 underwriting activity follows the Chapter 13 discharge in February 2024 and aligns with delayed or blocked access to refinancing.

Harm Index
ðŸ”´ Extreme Harm â€“ The refinance application was automatically referred for manual review solely due to bankruptcy flagging, despite a successful discharge. This error impeded access to refinancing and added significant procedural burden.
